# DirectoryWebsite
This is a basic directory website. 

This project stemmed from a directory built by a coworker of mine named Adam Schock https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-schock-88ab2273/. 

I saw the usefulness of his directory he had built to quickly access tools he uses on a daily basis and collaborated with him to give it a more modern design. 

Works in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
